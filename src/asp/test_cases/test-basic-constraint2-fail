% Test case name: test-basic-constraint2-fail.lp
% Test case goal: 
%		Fails to generate a timetable demonstratring that the constraint: "lecturers cannot teach 2 units at the same time" cannot be violated.
% Test case description:
% 		This test case fails to generates a timetable after attempting to violate the constraint mentioned above.
%		There is only 1 lecturer who teaches 2 units. Only 3 timesteps available and 4 lectures are scheduled. And 2 rooms.
%		This shows that the lecturer cannot teach twice at the same time, since there aren't enough timesteps. 
%		The only way for the timetable to be successfully generated would either if lecturer's could twice at the same time or if there were more timesteps 
%			(see test-basic-constraint2-success.lp)
% Expected output: a timetable with a single unit per timestep

timesteps(1..3).
